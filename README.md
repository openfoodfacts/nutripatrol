# **NutriPatrol üõ°Ô∏è**

**A collaborative tool to monitor and improve food product data on Open Food Facts.**

NutriPatrol is a web-based application designed to help the Open Food Facts community ensure the quality and accuracy of the data in the world's largest open database of food products. It allows users to easily patrol recent changes, spot inaccuracies, and contribute to making the food supply chain more transparent.

Production: <https://nutripatrol.openfoodfacts.org>
Pre-production: <https://nutripatrol.openfoodfacts.net>

## This is the backend
- The frontend is located at https://github.com/openfoodfacts/nutripatrol-frontend

## **üåü About the Project**

The goal of NutriPatrol is to gamify the process of data verification for Open Food Facts. Moderators can quickly swipe through recent reports, to act on true issues and mark them as fixed, or flag incorrect ones as not a problem. This helps maintain the integrity of the data that powers countless apps and research projects related to food, nutrition, and health.

### **Key Features:**

* **üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Patrol Recent Reports:** Quickly review and verify edits made to products.  
* **‚úÖ Approve or Flag from many places:** Basic integration is available in the website (openfoodfacts-server), being added to openfoodfacts-explorer and the mobile app (smooth-app)  
* **üì± Mobile-Friendly:** A responsive design that works on any device.
